WiiU/vWii Save Manager

**You need to run haxchi/iosuhax/mocha cfw first in order for this homebrew to work.**

**Got it working with CBHC but not extensively tested. Not tested in normal haxchi.**

This homebrew allows you to backup your Wii U and vWii savegames to the SD card and also restore them.
Up to 256 backups can be made per title.
Backups are stored in sd:/wiiu/backups.

For sorting Titles press R to change sorting method and press L to change between descending and ascending.

Use it at your own risk and please report any issues that may occur.

**Needs freetype-2.8 library for compiling.**
